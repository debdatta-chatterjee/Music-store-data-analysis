This project focuses on analyzing a Music Store database using SQL queries to extract meaningful business insights related to customer behavior, sales performance, and music trends. 

The Music_Store_Query.sql file contains a series of well-structured queries that demonstrate the use of fundamental and advanced SQL concepts such as table joins, filtering conditions, aggregation, grouping, sorting, and subqueries. 
These queries are designed to answer key business questions such as identifying top customers by revenue, most popular music genres, invoice distribution by country, and best-selling artists. By joining multiple tables like Customer, Invoice, Track, Genre, and Artist, the queries simulate real-world scenarios and provide hands-on experience in working with relational databases. 

This project is ideal for anyone looking to improve their SQL skills, understand how to draw insights from raw data, or practice working with a sample database like Chinook. It serves as a practical exercise in data exploration and business intelligence through structured query language.
